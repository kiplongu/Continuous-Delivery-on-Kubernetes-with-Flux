Lab 7A. Setting Up the Staging Environment

This lab walks you through the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster with Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE), a managed service offered by Google Cloud.
This assumes that you have chosen to use a Google Cloud-based setup. In case you would like
to bring your own nodes and configure Kubernetes on those, you could refer to this guide
instead: Lab K101 - Install Kubernetes with Kubeadm - Kubernetes Tutorial with CKA/CKAD
