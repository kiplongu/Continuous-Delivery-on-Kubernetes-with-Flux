# Lab 11. Automating Image Updates
Automate scan registry and update image metadata
Automate the commit of new image tags to GitHub
Note: If you see discrepancies between instructions in the video lessons versus the lab guide,
trust the lab guide, as it gets updated often and is expected to contain working code.

# Reflecting Image Updates
# Enable Image Automation
At the time of writing this lab (May 2021), Image Automation Controllers and Image Reflector
Controllers are in Alpha. Donâ€™t use image automation in production yet; keep it to
non-production environments only. If you live on the bleeding edge and still decide to use it in
production, we suggest setting it to push to a new branch, which then can be merged into the
main/release branches to trigger the actual deployment.
